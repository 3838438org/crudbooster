Help Default Controller :

+ CustomApiController
You can use this controller if you want to make your own API Controller without CRUDBooster API Generator

+ FrontController
You should declare any methods that will be used as your front end in FrontController
But you may still create your own any Controllers as Laravel Documentation, and set your own Route.
